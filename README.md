# EDA and Feature Engineering on Google Play Store Data

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering (FE)** on the **Google Play Store dataset**. The goal is to clean, analyze, and transform the data to gain insights and improve its usability for machine learning models.

## 📂 Files in This Repository
- `EDA_FE_google_play_store.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing the complete EDA and Feature Engineering process.
- `README.md` – Project documentation.
- `google_cleaned.csv` - A csv file contain the cleaned data.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understanding the dataset structure
- Handling missing values
- Visualizing key trends using Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Identifying patterns and outliers

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering
- Cleaning and transforming data types
- Creating new features from existing ones
- Handling categorical variables
- Scaling and normalizing numerical data

## 📜 Dataset Information
The dataset contains details of mobile applications from the Google Play Store, including:
- **App Name**
- **Category**
- **Rating**
- **Reviews**
- **Size**
- **Installs**
- **Price**
- **Genres**, etc.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Feature transformation

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/EDA-and-FE-on-Google-play-store-data.git

📌 Future Work
